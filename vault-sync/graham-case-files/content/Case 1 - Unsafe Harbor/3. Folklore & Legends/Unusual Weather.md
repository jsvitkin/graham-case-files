For the last 3 days (starting on June, 7th) the area of Leith has experienced an unusual weather phenomenon. While the rest of the city had good, clear weather, Leith was subject to heavily localized downpours.
**The rain only started after sundown and continued until sunrise the following day.**

After talking with several witnesses, it could be confirmed, that the weather phenomenon is localized to a very specific area in [[Leith]].
