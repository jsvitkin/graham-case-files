## Information
A nervous teenager who performed a local ritual during an [[Beach Party|illegal party]], urged on by his friend Simon McAllice. He later admitted fear that the altered chant may have caused a strange weather event.

----
## Witness Testimony
Witness reported, that during the party, he participated in a dare. He was challenged to perform a ritual from the local legend related to [[The Stone]], an old semi-monolith. According to the local legend, as per Mr. Gabsmith's testimony, one has to run around the stone several times, while chanting a (presumably) Gaelic chant. The witness did add, that he did notice his friend, [[Simon McAllice]], was especially interested in him performing said ritual.
As per Mr Gabsmith's testimony, the witness was asked to perform the ritual using a slightly altered chant. _Unfortunately, he was unable to remember the exact wording, that he was supposed to chant._
Finally the witness stated, that [[Simon McAllice|Mr. McAllice]] has been missing since the party.

>Mr. Gabsmith was first noticed during this investigation by his especially nervous and suspicious behaviour, that could be partially explained by his age and subjective fear of punishment, as during the party the underage teenagers were drinking alcohol and the location itself was illegal. 
>However: during the interview the witness did reveal, that he was frightened, the ritual may have caused the [[Unusual Weather]] phenomenon.
