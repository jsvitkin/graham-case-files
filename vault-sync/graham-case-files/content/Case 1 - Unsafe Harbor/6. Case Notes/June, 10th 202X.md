I received a message from E. She might have another "suspicious case" for me. The body of a 24 year old man, Thomas Miller, has been found behind a coffee shop in Leith. Initial CoD appears to be suspicious. Victim shows signs of drowning, but was found not in close proximity to a large body of water.
I have started a new case file. Initial research into the area did not show any increased crime activity, but did show unusual, localized [[Unusual Weather]] phenomenon.
### 10:30h
Arrived at the scene. Scene was cleared out. On my way back to the car ran into Ewan Robinson and a trainee. They went into [[Irish Dude Coffee & Food]] to interrogate the employees - probably a normal canvas. 
The scene itself was cleaned. No discernible trace evidence. The only body of water I found was a shallow puddle - not deep enough to drown in, even if he was face-down in it while being unconscious.
While in the car taking notes, noticed a suspicious man. The Mad Priest, as the others in the community call him. His presence here confirms suspicions of supernatural activity. 
Met another man, during the investigation. Called himself "Glen".
Works at the dockyard, came to the coffee-shop a few times. Met victim a few times in passing, when visiting the coffee-shop. Has seen the downpour, it has caused damage to the docks and docked vessels.
Overheard the conversation between the barista and the police: Victim did not have any enemies and was well liked.
### 11:00h
Decided to take Glen along. Better than him poking around on his own and getting himself killed in the process. The Mad Priest has left us soon after Glen arrived.
Finished the investigation of the crime scene, as expected no evidence. Received the [[Preliminary Post-Morten Examination Report]], that confirms my suspicions: Victim drowned in rain water. No external injuries, no drugs.

Arrived at the [[Bethany House]]. Ran into the Mad Priest again. More people in the shelter than usual, probably because of the [[Unusual Weather]]. Residents seem to be more distressed then usual. Followed Jerome, as he was talking with two of the residents, [[Anthony & Rowan]], about the events in [[Leith]]. Victim was flat on his stomach when found by Anthony. Looked "as if he was just sleeping. Like he just lied down there and drowned". I advised Anthony of his right to remain silent and have a solicitor present during any interrogations. They talked about how they found the victim and how strange the area feels like at the moment. That the strange rain seems to cover a circular area around Leith. Rowan also mentioned an old legend of the area, where a man was carried of by a storm and other [[Dock Worker Rumours]].

### 12:00h
Decided to go to the [[Beachwalk]]. According to Rowan, 3 days ago there was a party, that coincided with the very first downpour. Found footprints, belonging to a teenager we met on the beach. We found a teenager, [[Sky Gabsmith]], who at first tried to flee from us. After Glen caught him, he confessed, that during a party that occurred 3 days ago, he performed a dare, pressured by his friend [[Simon McAllice]], in which  he copied the ritual from [[The Stone]] legend. Directly after performing the ritual the weather shifted and the rainfall started. Simon has been missing since after the party. We examined the stone and aside from the stone being of a different colour, we did not find any abnormalities.
I have informed Ellen of Simon McAllice's disappearance and asked her to look into the missing persons report for him and forward me all relevant information.
