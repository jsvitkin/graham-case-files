I received a message from E. She might have another "suspicious case" for me. The body of a 24 year old man, Thomas Miller, has been found behind a coffee shop in Leith. Initial CoD appears to be suspicious. Victim shows signs of drowning, but was found not in close proximity to a large body of water.
I have started a new case file. Initial research into the area did not show any increased crime activity, but did show unusual, localized [[Unusual Weather]] phenomenon.
### 10:30h
Arrived at the scene. Scene was cleared out. On my way back to the car ran into Ewan Robinson and a trainee. They went into [[Irish Dude Coffee & Food]] to interrogate the employees - probably a normal canvas. 
The scene itself was cleaned. No discernible trace evidence. The only body of water I found was a shallow puddle - not deep enough to drown in, even if he was face-down in it while being unconscious.
While in the car taking notes, noticed a suspicious man. The Mad Priest, as the others in the community call him. His presence here confirms suspicions of supernatural activity. 
Met another man, during the investigation. Called himself "Glen".
Works at the dockyard, came to the coffee-shop a few times. Met victim a few times in passing, when visiting the coffee-shop. Has seen the downpour, it has caused damage to the docks and docked vessels.
Overheard the conversation between the barista and the police: Victim did not have any enemies and was well liked.
### 11:00h
Decided to take Glen along. Better than him poking around on his own and getting himself killed in the process. The Mad Priest has left us soon after Glen arrived.
Finished the investigation of the crime scene, as expected no evidence. Received the [[Preliminary Post-Morten Examination Report]], that confirms my suspicions: Victim drowned in rain water. No external injuries, no drugs.

Arrived at the [[Bethany House]]. Ran into the Mad Priest again. More people in the shelter than usual, probably because of the [[Unusual Weather]]. Residents seem to be more distressed then usual. Followed Jerome, as he was talking with two of the residents, [[Anthony & Rowan]], about the events in [[Leith]]. Victim was flat on his stomach when found by Anthony. Looked "as if he was just sleeping. Like he just lied down there and drowned". I advised Anthony of his right to remain silent and have a solicitor present during any interrogations. They talked about how they found the victim and how strange the area feels like at the moment. That the strange rain seems to cover a circular area around Leith. Rowan also mentioned an old legend of the area, where a man was carried of by a storm and other [[Dock Worker Rumours]].

### 12:00h
Decided to go to the [[Beachwalk]]. According to Rowan, 3 days ago there was a party, that coincided with the very first downpour. Found footprints, belonging to a teenager we met on the beach. We found a teenager, [[Kai Gabsmith]], who at first tried to flee from us. After Glen caught him, he confessed, that during a party that occurred 3 days ago, he performed a dare, pressured by his friend [[Simon McEllis]], in which  he copied the ritual from [[Pennybap Stone]] legend. Directly after performing the ritual the weather shifted and the rainfall started. Simon has been missing since after the party. We examined the stone and aside from the stone being of a different colour, we did not find any abnormalities.
I have informed Ellen of Simon McAllice's disappearance and asked her to look into the missing persons report for him and forward me all relevant information.

Origin of the phenomenon appears to be a circle cantered around [[Pennybap Stone]].
Contacted E again, she confirmed that [[Simon McEllis]] has been reported missing. Missing People Scotland confirms, that he has been last seen June, 8th.

## 12:30h
Decided to look into [[Simon McEllis|McEllis]] and visit his parent's house. To avoid involving SP, we decided on a cover as "hired help" for the catholic church looking into a string of teenage disappearances. Simon might have been involved with a criminal element. His mother reported, that he had trouble at school.
It took some convincing, Jerome's BO does not help with this really, but we managed to get inside the appartment.
![[mc-ellis-appartment-inside.png]]
Mrs McEllis told us, that Simon's father was involved with criminals when Simon was still younger, but she claims, that he has changed and broken all contact off with them. Their relationship has changed significantly after the death of his father. She claims, that he deeply misses his father. On June, 7th, she fought with Simon after receiving a call from the school. The school claimed that he stole a book from the "occult club".

Could get permission to search Simon's room.
![[simons-room.png]]
Phone charger present, football shoes present: The boy never went to practice. The scent of burnt rosemary hints at a ritual, clothes missing from his drawers and ripped out pages out of his notebook. He wrote with enough force to leave an impression on the empty pages:

*"Shellycoat, Shellycoat, gang awa' hame, I cry na' yer mercy, I fear na' yer name!"*

A variant of the original chant, but I need more time with my books to figure out a connection. Glenn found the boy's notebook and manged to gain access. The boy was searching for fairies and "Grimward". The latter is extremely disconcerting.

[Several Lines are completely scratched out]

## 14:00h
Had to reveal some information about my past to the other hunters. The boy searching for me by name is a bad development. They insisted we take a look at my apartment in Corstopphine, just in case Simon decided to make an appearance.
Made a small stop at Gregg's for lunch to go. Apartment was clean - obviously. But After talking over the facts, the option presented itself, that Simon might be seeking revenge for his father's death. I had E. look-up the incident report and there was no connection to [[Thomas Miller]].

We decided that we should split up: Glenn would go to the school, while Jerome will take a look at the real stone.

## 16:00h
Getting access to the [[Leith Academy]] has proven challenging for Glenn and he was unsuccessful. The information we could have gained there, would surely be useful, but it is locked for us for now.

Meanwhile, Jerome and I, paid a visit to the sewage plant and found the real [[Pennybap Stone|Stone]]. There was no significant new information, other than the fact that people have been performing the ritual around it a lot of times without ever summoning anything forth. Ergo, the stone alone is not the only requirement. We decided to stop the investigation for the day and went our own ways.
This church of Jerome's, that a topic for a discussion most certainly. Something supernatural is going on there.

## 17:30h
Went to the trailer and started my research. There is surprisingly a lot about it in the Library. My uncle, William, was the one, who introduced the new chant. He did it in hopes of making sure no-one called out the creature again. Sadly his ruse did not work out the way he wanted it to.
It will be a long night for me.
