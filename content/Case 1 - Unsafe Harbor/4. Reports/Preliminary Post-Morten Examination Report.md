## 4. Summary and Preliminary Conclusion

Mr Thomas Miller, a 24-year-old male, was found deceased in an outdoor location in Edinburgh with evidence of significant rainfall in the vicinity.

No natural disease, trauma, or toxicological findings were identified that would otherwise explain or contribute to the death.

There are no immediate indications of third-party involvement based on the physical and chemical examination to date.

**Cause of Death (Preliminary):** Drowning (likely in rainwater)  
**Manner of Death:** Undetermined (pending further police investigation)
