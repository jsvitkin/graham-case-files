---
## Witness Testimony
Mrs. McEllis has an estranged relationship with her son. The relationship worsened after the death of her husband and has not mended since.
Shortly before Simon's disappearance she was contacted by the [[Leith Academy]] and informed about Simon stealing a book from the occult club. While he has denied this to her, evidence discovered in his room corroborates this accusation.
Her husband had connections to criminals in the past, but according to her, he broke off all relationships many years ago.
