## Information
Was at a party 3 nights ago. The real Simon had sex during the party.
He took a dare during the party. Was egged on by the real Simon, whose behaviour was strange in the preceding days. Party got interrupted as the rain started. The dare was connected to a [[The Stone]]. After performing the dare, the weather turned immediately. Real Simon made the Fake Simon change his chant. He has been missing ever since.
