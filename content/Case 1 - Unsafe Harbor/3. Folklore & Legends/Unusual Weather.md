For the last 3 days the area of Leith has experienced an unusual weather phenomenon. While the rest of the city had good, clear weather, Leith was subject to heavily localized downpours.
**The rain only started after sundown and continued until sunrise the following day.**

After talking with several witnesses, it could be confirmed, that the weather phenomenon is localized to a very specific area in [[Leith]].
