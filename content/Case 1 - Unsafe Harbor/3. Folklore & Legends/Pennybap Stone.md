There is an enchanted boulder, that was moved from the beach to the sewage plant a few years ago.
According to local legend a demon or spirit can be called from it when you run around it 3 times while saying a chant.

There are several versions of the chant.
*“Shellycoat, Shellycoat, Gang awa hame, I cry na yer master, I cry na yer name”*

The real stone is situated next to the sewage plant.

People have been running around the stone clearly, judging by the trail, but no creatures have been called so far.
